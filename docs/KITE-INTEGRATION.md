# Kite integration — Passport Runtime

Pinned Passport documentation: b005121f008c005fc94cf42b2d29e9a3aba2ec99. Service schema remains 893a27509648b660bbba626b0da59619a94f04ab; A2A remains cae0888dd6f94d4722a8509989ba45496a2d5e44.

request_session returns AllowanceAvailable, ReuseCandidate, ExistingSessionReview, HumanActionRequired or Blocked instead of treating every create as an approval request. use_allowance(operation_id, confirmed_allowance=True) binds an already selected allowance, without silently switching from a separate session. separate_session previews first; confirmed=True requires a stored preview. accept_reuse supports the documented reuse_candidates array and requires an explicit same-goal decision. Discovery uses service list --query / service get with JSON output; legacy service search is still documented upstream.

## Payment compatibility

The service schema allows Kite networks eip155:2366/2368 and the observed facilitator advertises both. Current Passport dev documentation lists Arc testnet; its advertised buyer-network list is not identical to that seller schema. Validate the exact installed CLI, Passport environment, asset, receiver and SIWX behavior before claiming interoperability. Facilitator support is not a completed Passport purchase. Do not silently change networks, payment sources or approved budgets.

Current account-allowance and separate-session flows must be handled separately. Create with a delegation can return allowance_available rather than an approval request; independent approval now has explicit --separate/--preview semantics. Never execute next_command as shell code. Keep the original Passport idempotency key for ambiguous payment outcomes, and use the original wallet/session for free recovery.

For services 07–10: configure and host a real public HTTPS origin, validate and export a non-placeholder manifest only after evidence exists, discover it through the actual catalog (or use the explicit operator URL while registration is pending), get an authorized Passport session/allowance, purchase once, then retrieve with the original wallet. Pass operation_id in the merchant body and keep Passport's idempotency key distinct. Record receipt, network, artifact hash and any job/result URL for the ledger. This is an operator workflow specification; this release has not executed a funded purchase.

## Portfolio integration

The intended workflow is Passport Runtime → Paid Jobs → a local document processor or a bounded browser service → Payment Ledger. Merchant Console manages configured sellers and x402 Testkit checks unsigned contracts and offline fault behavior. The A2A driver verifies a separate coordination Runtime. Keep independent repositories and evidence for each stage.
